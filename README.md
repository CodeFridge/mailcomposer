## Installation

## Usage



## Envelope

Envelope is emitted with an `'envelope'` event and it has an object as a param
that includes a `from` address (string) and a list of `to` addresses (array of
strings) suitable for forwarding to a SMTP server as `MAIL FROM:` and `RCPT TO:`.

    mailcomposer.on("envelope", function(envelope){
        console.log(envelope);
        // {from:"sender@example.com", to:["receiver@example.com"]}
    });
